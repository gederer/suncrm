- Ensure 100% compliance with DNC and TCPA regulations
- Provide complete visibility into lead acquisition costs and ROI
- Enable data rollback capabilities for risk mitigation

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Data Format Inconsistency**: Lead vendors provide data in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) with different column layouts
2. **Data Quality Issues**: Frequent capitalization errors, formatting inconsistencies, and incomplete information
3. **Compliance Risk**: Manual DNC checking is error-prone and time-consuming
4. **Duplicate Management**: No systematic approach to identifying and merging duplicate leads
5. **Cost Opacity**: Unable to track true cost per lead through the entire lifecycle
6. **No Rollback Capability**: Errors in import cannot be easily reversed
7. **Manual Processing**: Current process requires significant manual intervention

### Business Impact
- **Operational Inefficiency**: 4-6 hours per import for manual processing
- **Compliance Exposure**: Risk of TCPA violations ($500-$1,500 per violation)
- **Poor Data Quality**: 40% of leads have quality issues affecting conversion
- **Lost Revenue**: Unable to optimize vendor selection based on ROI
- **Customer Experience**: Setters waste time with bad data
